File Content: "Read Me" information on the Python program.

The Python program starts by parsing the Verilog netlist, "TopCell.v", and storing the data in a nested dictionary format. After parsing, the program displays the modules found and asks the user to select one of them. According to the selected module, the program then counts the instances of each module and primitive in its hierarchy and displays them to the user.
